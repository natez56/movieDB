  <h1> Movie Database for Movies Released and in Production </h1>
  <h2> By: Nathan Zimmerman & Sean Ng </h2>
</div>
<div>
  <p> This database models movies, genres, production companies, directors, and 
  their relationships. Some things to note:</p>
  <ul class="home">
    <li> When adding a movie they must have a title, genre, and production company associated with them. </li>
    <li> When adding a director they must have a movie they have directed. </li>
    <li> A movie cannot be a sequel to itself. </li>
    <li> If a director is removed from directing a movie and is no longer listed as directing a single movie, then he will be removed from the database. </li>
  </ul>
